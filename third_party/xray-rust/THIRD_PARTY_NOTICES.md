# Third-Party Notices

This project can download and bundle the routing-data files listed below.
Those files are not covered by the project's own source-code license. If you
redistribute an application containing them, retain these notices and comply
with their respective licenses.

The pinned versions and checksums below are also enforced by
`scripts/fetch-geodata.sh`.

## uTLS-derived ClientHello profile data

- Project:
  [refraction-networking/uTLS](https://github.com/refraction-networking/utls)
- Pinned Go module:
  `v1.8.3-0.20260301010127-aa6edf4b11af`
- Upstream revision:
  [`aa6edf4b11af`](https://github.com/refraction-networking/utls/tree/aa6edf4b11af)
- License: BSD 3-Clause
- Upstream license:
  [uTLS LICENSE](https://github.com/refraction-networking/utls/blob/aa6edf4b11af/LICENSE)

The profile-name set in `crates/xray-utls` mirrors Xray/uTLS identifiers. The
deterministic tools under `tools/reality-oracle/` execute the pinned uTLS
implementation, and their reviewed output supplies ClientHello ordering,
protocol identifiers, and lengths used by
`crates/xray-transport/src/utls_profiles.rs`.
